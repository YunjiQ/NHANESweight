# Project Introduction

This project delves into the prevalent concern of weight management, leveraging data from the NHANES—conducted by the NCHS under the CDC—to examine weight trends and loss methods among U.S. adults. Focusing on self-reported weight changes over the past year, the study aims to identify effective factors influencing weight loss, the role of diet, and beneficial dietary habits. 

The project is conducted by the Final Project - Group 10 in EDAV class.
