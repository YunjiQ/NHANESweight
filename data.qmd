# Data

## Description

Identify one or more **data sources** (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe **how the data are collected** and **by whom**. Describe the **format** of the data, the frequency of **updates, dimensions**, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Explain how you **plan to import** the data. Carefully document your sources **with links** to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.)

The data set used in this project is acquired from the National Center for Health Statistics under the Weight History section in the study of "2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic Questionnaire Data - Continuous NHANES"(<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&Cycle=2017-2020>).

The data is collected through the interview and questionnaire. The trained interviewers are asked to answer these questions in the home using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview system.
