    "text": "1 Introduction\nHow do you consider your weight? Have you ever tried to lose weight in the past few years? It is interesting to observe that weight loss has become a prevalent concern in the lives of many adults. More and more people started to lose weight and focus on achieving a balanced and fit body, which prompted a growing interest in scientific and efficient methods to achieve this goal.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. Under the guidance of the CDC, NHANES empowers researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals with the tools to understand health trends, identify emerging issues, and tailor interventions to the specific needs of diverse populations.\nRecognizing the significance of this health endeavor, the NHANES conducted a survey on the weight history on a two-year cycle basis to keep the information updated. The survey targeted thousands of participants aged 16 years and older, encompassing individuals with diverse habits and racial backgrounds. The primary objective of this survey is to investigate the dynamics of weight loss during the past 12 months and explore the methods that are endeavored by its participants to lose or maintain their weight.\nWith the survey data from NHANES, we can gain some insights from exploring this large sample. In this project, we will be practically interested in exploring the effective impact factors of weight loss, answering questions like how psychological intent promotes the performance of weight loss, whether a strict diet helps lose weight, and what kind of dietary habit would benefit weight loss. We will focus on the questionnaire data, which indicates the self-reported weight changes and some related factors. We will conduct data pre-processing, trend analysis, correlation study, and statistic tests. According to the research on the data set, we will be able to conclude the most obvious and possible method or combination of methods for controlling the weights."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe project utilizes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), obtained from the Questionnaires, Datasets, and Related Documentation section covering the cycles spanning from 2017 to March 2020.\nThe data is collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through interviews and questionnaires. NHANES employs a comprehensive approach to data collection. Trained interviewers conduct in-person interviews and ask questions by using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. The questionnaire gathers a broad range of dimensions on demographics, health status, dietary habits, and lifestyle factors directly from participants. Participants aged 16 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible. However, eligibility varies by age for some questions.\nNHANES data are collected in different formats. Questionnaire responses are recorded in a structured manner. Laboratory test results and physical measurements are often numerical. In this project, we will utilize the questionnaire responses to record the self-reported weight changes and some related factors. The research will be conducted surrounding the possible impact factor for weight loss, and the detailed research plan shown in section 2.2. The dimension for the original data set is 10195 samples with 36 features. However, based on the research questions, we will select the relevant features and conduct pre-processing, and the pre-processed data set has 4781 objects with 17 features.\nNHANES is conducted a two-year cycle starting 1999. While the new data is collected regularly, the release of updated datasets may not occur as frequently, and the data from 2021 to 2023 is currently unavailable. In our project, we use the data from 2017 to March 2020 Pre-Pandemic instead of the data from 2019 to 2020 because of the immediate pandemic effects. The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle remained incomplete and the collected data are not nationally representative. To address this problem, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data.\nWhile the NHANES dataset is generally reliable and valuable, it is essential to be aware of potential issues and limitations when working with this data.\n\nThe complex sampling methodology may introduce sampling error, and non-response bias could affect the generalizability of the findings.\nSome information, such as dietary habits and lifestyle factors, is self-reported and subject to recall bias. Participants may not always accurately remember or report their behaviors, leading to potential inaccuracies.\nWhile NHANES captures a broad range of health indicators, it may not fully address all dimensions of health disparities. Certain subgroups may be underrepresented or face unique health challenges not fully captured in the survey.\n\nImport the data:\n\nDownload the “P_WHQ Data” XPT file from the CDC website.\nImport and read the data in RStudio with read_xpt() function.\n\nDocumentation and Links:\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-March 2020 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&Cycle=2017-2020"

We will also calculate and show each sample’s BMI for further research.\n\n\n2.2.2 Age Distribution at Heaviest Weight\nThe study will examine the distribution of participants’ self-reported heaviest weight across various ages to identify whether there is a common age period for weight gain.\n\n\n2.2.3 Longitudinal BMI Changes\nSince BMI is more scientific and representative of personal weight health, trends and patterns in BMI changes will be analyzed longitudinally to understand the dynamics of weight management over time.\n\n\n2.2.4 Correlation Analysis Between Factors and BMI Change\n\nExamining Weight Loss Intentions\nThe concordance between individuals’ weight loss intentions and actual BMI changes will be explored.\nDieting and BMI\nThe relationship between dieting behaviors (e.g. skipping meals, eating less) and BMI changes.\nDietary Preferences\nThe association between dietary preferences and BMI trajectories will be assessed.\nCombined Impact\nA multivariate approach will be used to understand the collective impact of various factors on BMI changes."
